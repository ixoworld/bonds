# Code with Us Workshop - Nov 03 2020
Make your own Automated Market-Maker, using the new Cosmos SDK Bonds Module

- Discover the new Cosmos-SDK Bonds module, the Automated Market-Maker (AMM) with universal bonding curves. The workshop will be hosted by [Miguel Dingli](https://twitter.com/MiguelDingli), the lead developer of this module, and [Shaun Conway](https://twitter.com/shaunbconway), founder of ixo.
- Learn how to configure your first AMM using a simple bonding curve for algorithmic pricing. Then we will move onto more advanced types such as Uniswap-type token pair swappers and Augmented Bonding Curves.
